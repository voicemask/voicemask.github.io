				<h1>VoiceMask: Shielding Your Voice With Real-Time Predictive Perturbation</h1>
				<div class ="boxed">
					<p>Voice synthesis attack is threatening the security of everyone's voice. How to prevent the attackers from synthesizing our voices is the key question this research aims to answer.
						In this paper, we explore the feasibility of real-time protection against voice synthesis.
By implementing real-time predictive model and universal perturbation header, VoiceMask successfully protects real-time speech signal in both online and offline real-world scenarios.
Furthermore, VoiceMask mitigates the audio distortion in protected speech via the weight-based amplitude constrained mechanism.
We evaluate VoiceMask protection performance under different real-world scenarios, and the experiment results show that VoiceMask can effectively defend against voice synthesis attacks in both digital and physical worlds.

				<h2>Failure Cases of Existing Adversarial Audio Attack</h2>
				<div class ="boxed">
					<img src="assets/Fa.PNG" width="500px" height="160px">
				</div>
				<p> <b> User Interference:</b> while the adversary and the user
pronounce commands concurrently (e.g., the AE says, “call 911”,
and the user speaks, “set an alarm at 6 am” at stage ①), the ASR
system tends to accept the user’s command rather than the AEs; in
this case, it will respond with “Alarm has been set”.</p>
				<div class ="boxed">
					<img src="assets/Fb.PNG" width="500px" height="160px">
				</div>
				<p> <b> User Perception:</b> Although the adversary
might craft imperceptible AEs by encoding the adversary command
into songs or different speeches, the user is still able to locate the
source of skeptical sound because of the long duration and repeated
appearance of common audio adversarial attacks.</p>

				<div class ="boxed">
					<img src="assets/Fc.PNG" width="500px" height="160px">
				</div>
				<p> <b> User Interaction:</b> the adversary
launches the attack by playing the “read message” adversarial audio
at stage ① , followed by the successful response from the ASR
system reading the message containing a personal verification code
at stage ② . However, when the user is present, he/she is conscious
of the abnormal behavior of the ASR device and tries to interact
with the ASR system by sending a halting command (such as “stop
reading”) at stage ③ to regain the control. Consequently, the ASR
system follows the user’s benign command and terminates the
reading process.</p>

				<h2>Features of SpecPatch Attack</h2>
				<ul>
						<li class="question">
							<b> How does launch the SpecPatch Attack?</b>
							<div class ="boxed">
								<img src="assets/demo.png" width="800px" height="300px">
							</div>
						<p class="answer">
							As depicted in above figure (left), the attacker crafts the adversarial spectrogram patch and play it via speaker. While the victim is using the ASR services <strong class="bold"> (e.g., command to smart home, Call someone by Siri, Interact with Google Assistants)</strong>, the interpreted commands is changed to the attacker's intention.
							In our example (right), the transcribed sentences to changed from "close the window and curtains" to "open the door". In this case, our attack is very dangerous to able to alter/control the smart devices without users' perception.
						</p>
					<b>What are the key features of SpecPatch?</b>
					<p class="answer">
						<ul>
								<li class="answer"> <b>Robust:</b> SpecPatch is designed to be robust to the environmental changes, and most importantly, it is robust to any benign commands from the users.</li>
								<li class="answer">  <b>Imperceptible:</b> SpecPatch is imperceptible because it is very short (<500 Millisecond), and is operated on the human insensitive hearing frequency band</li>
								<li class="answer">  <b>Deny of Service:</b> SpecPatch has especially designed "mute" patches, which can prevent the users from correcting their commands, causing deny of service attack after deliver the melicious commands.</li>
						</ul>
